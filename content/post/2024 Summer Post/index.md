Summer's been scorching, and not just because of the weather! My calendar's hotter than ever with upcoming conferences and workshops around the globe.

June kicked off with an amazing trip to Monterey, California for the 92nd MORS Symposium. Next up? I'm packing my bags for events in the United Kingdom and the University of Arkansas in July, followed by Germany in October.

My big challenge in the UK? Condensing 80 years of U.S. Operations Research into a 40-minute presentation! Wish me luck. But hey, this is my first international conference, and I'm stoked to learn how other countries approach use of OR and Analytics to support their military.

After the UK, I'll be catching up with colleagues and swapping teaching tips at the University of Arkansas' annual Faculty Meeting. Always a blast!

Finally, October takes me to Germany for the MORS Global Infrastructure Workshop. As the leader of Focus Group Two, we'll be diving deep into threats and vulnerabilities. But hey, who says work can't be fun? I'm definitely squeezing in some sightseeing before the workshop kicks off.
