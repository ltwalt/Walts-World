During my many travels this summer I have been watching Starz's "Black Sails". In keeping with my Age of Sail theme after visiting both the USS Constitution in Boston in April and then the HMS Victory in Portsmouth, UK in July, it seem appropriate to watch a show about sailing ships. And not just any sailing ships. In the tempestuous world of "Black Sails," amidst the swashbuckling pirates and high-seas drama, lies a subtle but powerful message about the value of thoughtfulness and deliberate action. In stark contrast to the breakneck pace of our modern lives, the characters in "Black Sails" often act without a fully formed plan, trusting in their ability to adapt and strategize as events unfold.

This approach may seem reckless at first glance, but it speaks to a deeper truth about human ingenuity and resilience. In a world without the constant distractions of the internet and social media, the pirates of Nassau are forced to rely on their own wits and the knowledge gleaned from observation, reading, and conversation. They are not afraid to take risks, but they also understand the importance of careful consideration and analysis.

### The Slow Burn of Creativity

In today's world of instant gratification, we have become increasingly intolerant of the slow burn of creativity. We want results now, and we are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli that demand our attention. This leaves little time for quiet reflection and the kind of deep thinking that leads to truly innovative ideas.

The characters in "Black Sails," however, understand that the best plans are often those that are allowed to simmer and evolve over time. They are not afraid to pause, to ponder, to write down their thoughts and explore different possibilities. This is the pace at which the human mind is naturally designed to work, and it is only through this kind of deliberate, unhurried process that we can truly unlock our full potential.

### The Illusion of Speed

Of course, there are times when quick thinking is necessary, but even the most lightning-fast decisions are usually the result of countless hours of training and preparation. The illusion of speed is often just that â€“ an illusion. In reality, the most successful people are those who have taken the time to develop their knowledge, skills, and intuition through years of dedicated practice.

The pirates of "Black Sails" may not have access to the latest technology or the most sophisticated tools, but they possess something far more valuable: the ability to think deeply, to learn continuously, and to trust in their own innate capacity for problem-solving. It is a lesson we would do well to remember in our own fast-paced, hyper-connected world.

### Embracing the Rhythm of Thought

In a society that seems to value busyness above all else, it is easy to forget the importance of slowing down and allowing ourselves the time and space to think. But as "Black Sails" reminds us, it is in these moments of quiet contemplation that our most creative and innovative ideas are born.

So let us take a page from the pirates' playbook and embrace the rhythm of thought. I know I have personally started writing a lot more during my daily routine and planned in plenty of time for reflection and deep thought. Although we don't have as much time to focus as in years past, we can use what time we have wisely.
