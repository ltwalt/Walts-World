This summer, amidst the whirlwind of travel, I found time to revisit a topic close to my heart: the challenge of getting people to adopt and utilize analytical models. Dr. Wilson Price and I co-authored a chapter on this very subject in the first edition of a book, and I recently updated it for the second edition.

While the chapter number changed (from 12 to 19), the core message remains the same. It's a message Wilson, who sadly passed away in 2020, was deeply passionate about. In his memory, I included a brief tribute at the beginning of the chapter.

The update also reflects recent developments, such as the addition of the Space Force to the Department of Defense and the global deployment of the Navy's Replenishment At Sea Planner (RASP). These are just a few of the changes you'll find in the new edition.

Revisiting this chapter brought back fond memories of discussing change management and analytics with Wilson over countless lunches during his time as a visiting professor. His insights were invaluable, and they ignited my own passion for this topic, leading me to teach courses on organizational change and eventually write my own book.

The importance of change management in the realm of analytics cannot be overstated. After all, even the most brilliant models are meaningless if they aren't put into practice.

If you're curious to learn more, I encourage you to check out the second edition of the book, which is set to release on August 21st, 2024. You can find it on Amazon with the link below.
