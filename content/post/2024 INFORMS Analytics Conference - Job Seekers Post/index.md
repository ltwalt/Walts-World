The INFORMS Analytics Conference isn't just about the latest analytics trends or snagging that perfect job offer. It's about connecting with people – the mentors, the colleagues, the friends-you-haven't-met-yet. If you're searching for your next adventure in analytics, here's how to make the most of this conference, one genuine interaction at a time.

These tips were presented during an INFORMS sponsored panel on Wednesday, April 3, 2024. Many thanks to my fellow panelists, Tayaba Nadeem and Carol DeZwarte, for contributing to these tips.

### Before the Buzz: The Calm Before the Storm

Think of the prep work as laying the groundwork for meaningful conversations:

* **Materials Matter:** Your resume and LinkedIn are your first impressions. Make sure they're polished and tell a consistent story about your skills and goals. Get that resume review – outside eyes can spot things you might miss.  
* **Authenticity is Key:** This isn't about memorizing a stiff elevator pitch. You'll shine most when you're comfortable being yourself. Know your strengths, what you're passionate about, and the type of environment you thrive in.
* **The App is Your Ally:** Download the conference app ahead of time. It's more than a scheduler – it's a connector. Use it to see who's around, send messages, and keep yourself organized in the hubbub.  

### Where the Magic Happens: During the Conference

Remember, everyone is there for the same reasons: to learn, grow, and expand their network. Embrace it!

* **Breaking the Ice:** Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation. Start simple: compliment someone's presentation, share an observation about the lunch spread – anything to get a friendly dialogue going.
* **Listen More, Talk Less:** This is where the real connections happen. Ask thoughtful questions, find out about a person's work and what excites them. Showing authentic interest goes a long way.
* **It's a Two-Way Street:** Job-hunting can feel one-sided. Flip the script! Ask how you can help your new contacts. Connections made now can lead to opportunities down the line, even in unexpected ways.

### After the Conference: Nurturing Connections

The conference is just the beginning. Here's how to follow through:

* **Timely Follow-Ups:** Don't let those conversations fade! Within a day or so, send a quick message on LinkedIn or email, reminding your contact how you met.
* **The Power of Reflection:** Look back on your notes. What inspired you? Who seemed like a great mentor? Did a particular company spark your interest? Use these insights to guide your next steps.
* **Beyond the Job Search:** The INFORMS community is about long-term support. Stay engaged on INFORMS Connect, volunteer if a chance comes up, and continue building relationships.

### Remember...

The INFORMS Analytics Conference is full of brilliant, passionate people. You belong in this space. Be confident, be curious, and focus on building genuine connections – the job opportunities will follow.
