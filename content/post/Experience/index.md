Experience is something this is obtained over time. This may be through observation, learning, or the school of hard knocks. There are two different types of experience when applied to analytics. First, there is the experience with the analytical solution. This could be obtained through education or prior use. Typically, analytics professionals have a main focus area where they have applied certain tools such as optimization, simulation, or machine learning. 

The second type of experience is related to the business problem. This includes familiarity with the data and the context. 

An example of experince for both types is an analyst that has used Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) optimization in the past for several projects and for their Masters' thesis research. They feel very comfortable using this technique and can explain the problem formulation well. They are trying to answer a business problem that includes routing trains to minimize the time it takes freight to get between two locations over a multinodal network. The analytics professional has worked in the train industry for several years and is familiar with the data sources, structure, and values. This is an example of a high degree of experience.
