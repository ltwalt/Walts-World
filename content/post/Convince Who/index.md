All analytics projects have an element of convincing someone. This someone could be a fellow analytics team member, the CEO of the organization, or anywhere inbetween. It could also be a client or an audiance at a conference presentation. Each on of these "them" are unique and require an independent amount of evidence. 

Especially when the audience is going to make a business decision supported by the analytics product or solution. What must the argument or the left side of the equation overcome to reach the tipping point? How different is this point for each audience? 

An advanced analytical audience may dig deeper into your analytical solution and data. They may ask challenging questions concerning your choice of methodology or technology used running the model. Less analytically advanced audiences may focus on the business aspects of the modeling such as the data, assumptions, or the results. It is unrealistic to have one presentation or writen document that answers all the questions and challenges of both groups. First, the AP must define their target and then refine their message. 

There shouldn't be a barrier of advanced math techniques with the audience. Communication methods such as using metephors that utilize a use case in terms that someone can understand and atomizing knowledge should be used frequently. Both help in taking the magic out of the math and making it real. 

What happens when there is resistance to the analytical solution? Then the equation's left side must be increased by increasing one of the factors. Perhaps a more experienced AP with specific business experience is required to be brought onto the team. A recombination of the communication methods. Or focusing on creating swift trust by defining roles and clearer communication of future collaboartions. These are options that lie outside the area of refining the analytics model and providing better data. Those things are the first items that APs try and change when a negative result occurs during a project. This behavior makes perfect sense due to the fact this was reinforced by academic training where the correct answer is always related to the math and/or data. 

Where do decision makers fall into the spectrum of the "them"? Depending on what the background of the decision maker is educationally, experientually, and proficiently, they could be anywhere on this specturm. The AP must do their homework and research the "them". What is there academic background? Experince in the industry, and do they have any interest that could be used as metephors with the math to make understanding easier?

What would it take to convince someone to use an analytical product. Perhaps a few presentations, emails, issue papers, or some combination of these. A basic engagement plan is required to develop the appropriate approach. The same approach cannot be used for every level or even potentially for the same person in the future. If done correctly, even someone afraid of math should be educated in small bits so that the next time they are introduced to an analytical solution, their fear is lower than the time before.
