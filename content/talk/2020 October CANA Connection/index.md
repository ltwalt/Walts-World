summary: In today's special Team CANA spotlight episode, our host Rob Cranston will be talking with a handful of active military and veteran TEAM CANA members, about some of the special military workforce transitioning programs that are available, how to get involved in those programs, what it's like making the transition to the civilian workforce, and how the team at CANA Advisors and the CANA Foundation are involved. A big thanks goes out to Hannah Wallace, Walt DeGrange, Cornelious Young, and Kenny McRostie for being part of today's Team CANA veteran spotlight interview.
