With the recent success of sports teams heavily using analytics (Dodgers, Patriots, Capitals, Warriors, Leicester City F.C.), does this mean that analytics has gained a foothold in the sports world? I use a k-means clustering model to determine if performance since 2015 in the four major US sports can support this question. And is there a career path that a high school student can use to become a sports analytics professional? This presentation attempts to answer that question by exploring all the areas of the application of analytics in sports. The final point the brief makes is that by using sports data to teach k-means clustering, students are more interested in learning advanced analytical concepts.
